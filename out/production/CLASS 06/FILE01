TIME COMPLEXITY AND RECURSION

A function calling itself is called recursion.
Important - Base condition is necessary in recursion, otherwise function will go into infinite loop.

Fibonacci Number
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
